            My names Adam, I’m looking for a full-time Web Development job! I think I can effectively do the job. Read
            more below...
        </p>

        <p class="strong-i">Hey There –</p>
        
        <p>
            I’m Adam McKnight a Software Engineer with a focus on front-end web development. My passion for computers
            started when I was a little kid, and the rest, well is history.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2013 I started volunteering at my Church recording and editing videos, which over the years led to
            designing graphics. This urge to be creative then led to me taking a pivotal step, by attending Butler Tech,
            D. Russel Lee during my Junior and Senior years of High School. In 2016, I graduated with both High School
            Credentials and a Certificate of Digital Media.
        </p>
            After graduating High School I took the normal route of applying for colleges. Landing on my local community
            college as the best option. While attending my first year in 2017, I was introduced to Web Development.
            Shortly thereafter, I was “hooked”.

        <p>
            In 2019, three years after my “supposed graduation date” and applying for jobs realizing my degree wouldn’t
            matter – I left college.
       
            Since then, I’ve been working with Various Companies on a contract basis like Miami University, CityGate
            Church.

        <p>
            Now, I’m actively seeking a full-time Software Engineering position.
